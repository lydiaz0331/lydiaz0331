Credit Union Profolio Maximization and Risk Minimization Capstone Project
-------------
The business insight of this project are:
   - Explore optimal ways to determine a volatility term for each customer profile to better understand the value of future loans.
   - Create an alternative, robust clustering model based on a multi-factor customer risk profile to investigate our customer credit tier system.
   - Apply machine learning methods and predictive analytic models on the current data to gain some potential new insights.

Model: **K-Medoids Clustering, Random Forest**
Conclusion:
   - Using Monte-Carlo simulation, we’ve determined a robust scaling method to determine new volatility figures for each of the currently defined credit tiers as to better simulate future investment environments.
   - Using K-Medoids Clustering--based on a customer’s origination credit score and their current debt to service ratio--we’ve determined new bins to classify our customers into a hierarchy of credit tiers.
   - While we achieved inconclusive results utilizing several predictive techniques, we achieved a high level of accuracy when using a Random Forest model to predict defaults.
