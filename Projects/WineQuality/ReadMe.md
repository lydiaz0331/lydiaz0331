Artificial Intelligence Project - White Wine Quality Classification
-------------
-	The objective of this project is to use the ANN Classifier to classify each wineâ€™s quality based on their variables and quality is a score between 0 and 10. Also, I want to maximize the prediction accuracy by tuning my model parameters such as activation method and number of layers, etc.

  -	Model: **ANN Classifier**
  - Data Source:[UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
  - Final Result:
    - ANN Classifier model using relu as the activation type with 3 hidden layers, each with 64 hidden units is the model that produces the lowest mae of 1.010 and the accuracy rate is 61.22%.
