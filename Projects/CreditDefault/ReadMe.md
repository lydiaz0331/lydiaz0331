Credit Card Default Project
-------------
The objective of this project is to use the supervised learning methods such as Logistic Regression to predict if a customer will default his/her credit card payment. The business insight of this project is to improve and ease the process of credit card default detection and therefore help the bankinf system to make better decisions.


  -	Model Performed: **Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree and Random Forest**
  - Data Source: 2005 transaction data of a commerical bank
  - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy Rate and Type II error rate
  - Final Result:
    - Overall, our analysis suggested that for modeling of credit card risk, the best prediction result is achieved by **Random Forest** with equal sample size
    - Trade-off between overall accuracy rate and more aggressive prediction on who actually default when predicted as “default”
    - However, Random Forest might not be intuitive and not easy to be implemented by banks
